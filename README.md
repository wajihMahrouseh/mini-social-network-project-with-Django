# Mini Social Network Project With Django 3.2

In this mini social network project, I tried to experience all the techniques and concepts that I learned about Django Framework from multiple resources like Django Docs, Django course from Coursera and a little few tutorials from youtube.

I built this project in 3 versions, like FBV, CBV and Generic View
you can see the diffrenet versions in unique folders:

The FBV version: mini_social_network_version__1.0
The CBV version: mini_social_network_version__1.1
The GCBV version: mini_social_network_version__1.2


I will upgrade my code continuously to make it more clean, readable, reusable and add more new features.

Hope you have a fun time with exploring my code and dont forget to try a live demo.
