# Mini Social Network Project With Django 3.2

In this mini social network project, I tried to experience all the techniques and concepts that I learned about Django Framework from multiple resources like Django Docs, Django course from Coursera and a little few tutorials from youtube.

I built this project in 3 versions, like FBV, CBV and I work on the generic view version recently but have not completed it yet.

I will upload the third version as soon as I complete it.
after that I will upgrade my code continuously to make it more clean, readable, reusable and add more new features.

Hope you have a fun time with exploring my code and dont forget to try a live demo.
